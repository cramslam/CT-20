# Week 7 Documentation / Reflection

## What I worked on:
This week, I worked on the project mostly. I ended up submitting it late yesterday, unfortunately, because of some issues I was having irl. For my project, I decided to work on the data self-portrait. I created a data visualization of some of my current favorite games right now and the amount of time I put into them as the "planets" in a galaxy, in which if you hover over them, it displays the information associated with them. The size of the planets also depicts how many hours I put into each game. I took inspiration from the league mastery website https://masterychart.com/.

## Progress / Accomplishments:
finished project 2

## Difficulties / Confusion:
I wanted to try to replicate the mastery chart website the best I could while still keeping the planet theme and honestly it was more difficult than I anticipated. I couldn't really seem to get the desired effect I wanted, especially figuring out how I would make the planets not collide with eachother/aware of their scale.

## Interests / Takeaways:
I like utilizing the mouse hover as an attempt to utilize an event listener concept like we learned in lecture. I know mouse hover counts more as an event handler, but still.

## Goals:
continue to lock in
