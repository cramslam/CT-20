# Week 3 Documentation / Reflection

## What I worked on:
This week was a big catch-up week for me. I focused mainly on getting more comfortable with the workflow of the class, as it is a bit different from what I have experienced. I setup and updated my GitHub repo, experimented and refreshed my skills using markdown via https://stackedit.io/. On top of that, I was mostly trying to understand how weekly documentation is functioning as an ongoing log as opposed to a polished writeup. I also reviewed the readings as well :P

## Progress / Accomplishments:
I created the GitHub repo
I practiced MD
Started thinking about the project

## Difficulties / Confusion:
I am still figuring out how informal these weekly responses can/are expected to be, and how much of the process vs outcome should be shown.

## Interests / Takeaways:
I am interested in the idea that documentation doesn't need to be refined/incredibly formal, it reminds me of the CT colloquium common place journal a bit

## Goals:
LOCK IN!!!!
Fully catch up and also possibly work on previous assignments
General goal for me as well, but I continue to try to stay on top of working out
