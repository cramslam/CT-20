# Week 4 Documentation / Reflection

## What I worked on:
This week was mostly digesting the blender x p5 applications, and also landing on the idea I ended up using for my project (the clock project).

## Progress / Accomplishments:
I finished the clock project as best as I could reasonably think of in my opinion. The idea was to be a critique on data centers and water usage, so the clock essentially is visualized as a tank of water, and as the day goes on, the water slowly depletes until the next day, refilling. 

## Difficulties / Confusion:
The hardest effect I had to figure out was how I could make the bubbles. At first I started using the random() function to see if that would look good but to me it just looked like visualized radiation, so I chose to use the noise() function combined with the speed utilized via frameCount. I came to a relatively visually appealing solution at the end, but it took some research to make it work.

## Interests / Takeaways:
The concept of the project was interesting, I like the idea of visualizing concepts in abstract ways. It reminds me of that one coding contest where the objective was to create the least intuitive UI for a volume bar.

## Goals:
Continue to practice
